# Recursive Descent Engine Replacement Plan

Replace Chevrotain's LL(k) lookahead-based parser engine with a speculative
backtracking engine derived from `@jesscss/parser`. The public API is preserved
exactly. The `Lexer` is improved but its interface is unchanged.

---

## Background

### Structural engine costs

1. **Error allocation during backtracking.** `CONSUME()` failure throws
   `new MismatchedTokenException()` which extends `Error`. V8 always calls
   `Error.captureStackTrace()` on construction — it walks the entire JS call
   stack and serializes every frame to a string. This is O(call-stack depth)
   and creates GC pressure on every failed alternative inside `OR()`.

2. **Lookahead cache overhead.** Every `OR()`, `MANY()`, `OPTION()`, and
   `AT_LEAST_ONE()` call does a `Map.get()` keyed on a bit-encoded integer
   (`rule short name | method type | occurrence index`) to retrieve a
   pre-computed lookahead function, then invokes that function. This is a fixed
   per-production tax even when no backtracking is needed.

3. **Recording phase hidden-class pollution.** `enableRecording()` adds
   instance methods to the parser object; `disableRecording()` deletes them
   (~80 `delete` calls). In V8, adding/deleting own properties transitions the
   object to a new hidden class. Any inline cache (IC) that was optimized for
   the previous shape becomes polymorphic or megamorphic until the JIT
   re-optimizes. Fix (Stage 5): stop shadowing prototype methods with instance
   properties entirely — check `RECORDING_PHASE` inside the prototype methods
   themselves so no `delete` is ever needed.

### Additional allocation costs found in audit

4. **State save/restore clones the errors array.** `saveRecogState()` calls
   `this.errors` (which may return a clone) and `this.RULE_STACK.slice()` on
   every backtrack point. With speculative parsing, the save should be three
   integers (position, errors length, stack depth) — no allocation at all.

5. **Token and IToken object shapes are not fixed at creation.**
   `createToken()` sets optional fields conditionally, so tokens with different
   config have different hidden classes. `augmentTokenTypes()` then adds four
   more fields — a shape transition on every token object. IToken has three
   different factory functions (`createOffsetOnlyToken`, `createStartOnlyToken`,
   `createFullToken`) producing three hidden classes; call sites accessing token
   properties become polymorphic. `isInsertedInRecovery` is added to recovery
   tokens after creation — another transition.

6. **Category matching uses two redundant structures.** `categoryMatchesMap`
   (object) and `categoryMatches` (array) both exist on every token type and
   encode the same information. A `Uint32Array` bitset replaces both with O(1)
   bitwise AND matching and eliminates two of the four fields added by
   `augmentTokenTypes()`.

7. **Lexer clones group structure on every `tokenize()` call.**
   `cloneEmptyGroups()` is called at the start of each tokenization to reset
   the result groups. It iterates all group definitions and creates new arrays.
   Groups are static metadata — only the result arrays need resetting, not the
   structure.

8. **CST building allocates a new object and location object per rule.**
   `cstInvocationStateUpdate()` calls `Object.create(null)` for each rule's
   children dictionary and allocates a fresh location object with six `NaN`
   fields. With deep grammars this is thousands of allocations per parse.
   Additionally `addTerminalToCst` creates a single-element array `[token]`
   for the first occurrence of each token type in a rule, causing hidden class
   transitions on the children arrays.

### Replacement strategies

- **SPEC_FAIL symbol** replaces Error-based backtracking. V8 does not call
  `captureStackTrace` for non-Error throws. A Symbol throw+catch is a non-local
  goto — zero allocation, branch-predictor friendly.
- **Speculative execution** replaces lookahead pre-computation. `OR()` tries
  alternatives in order; failed ones throw SPEC_FAIL, state is restored via
  three integer assignments, the next alternative is tried.
- **Fixed object shapes** from construction — all fields pre-declared with
  sentinel values so V8 sees one hidden class per object type from birth.
- **Bitset token matching** replaces `categoryMatchesMap` and `categoryMatches`
  with a `Uint32Array` MATCH_SET, computed once in `augmentTokenTypes()`.
- **Optional recording phase** means `performSelfAnalysis()` is a no-op by
  default. The recording mechanism is preserved for GAST tooling.

## Architecture After Replacement

```
RecursiveDescentParser        ← new core (CONSUME, OR, MANY, state, SPEC_FAIL)
  └─ EmbeddedActionsParser    ← RULE(), ACTION() passthrough, performSelfAnalysis no-op
       └─ CstParser           ← CST stack, CONSUME/SUBRULE overrides, visitor constructors
```

The `Lexer` class sits beside this hierarchy with an improved but
interface-compatible implementation.

---

## Stages

---

### Stage 0 — Settle token and IToken object shapes

**Goal:** Fix all hidden class instability in the token layer. All token objects
share one hidden class from birth; no shape transitions after construction.
This stage must land before Stage 1 — the new engine accesses `MATCH_SET`,
`isParent`, and other augmented fields unconditionally. Without a guaranteed
shape, every access would require `?.` or null checks throughout the engine.

#### What changes

**`TokenType` — pre-declare all fields in `createToken()`:**

```ts
function createToken(config: ITokenConfig): TokenType {
  return {
    name: config.name,
    PATTERN: config.PATTERN ?? undefined,
    LABEL: config.LABEL ?? undefined,
    GROUP: config.GROUP ?? undefined,
    PUSH_MODE: config.PUSH_MODE ?? undefined,
    POP_MODE: config.POP_MODE ?? false,
    LONGER_ALT: config.LONGER_ALT ?? undefined,
    LINE_BREAKS: config.LINE_BREAKS ?? undefined,
    START_CHARS_HINT: config.START_CHARS_HINT ?? undefined,
    CATEGORIES: config.CATEGORIES ? [...config.CATEGORIES] : [],
    // augmented — sentinel values, filled in by augmentTokenTypes()
    tokenTypeIdx: 0,
    isParent: false,
    MATCH_SET: null, // ← new; replaces categoryMatches + categoryMatchesMap
  };
}
```

- `categoryMatches` and `categoryMatchesMap` are removed entirely.
  `tokenMatcher()` and all internal category checks switch to bitset AND:
  ```ts
  function tokenStructuredMatcher(token: IToken, expected: TokenType): boolean {
    return (
      token.tokenTypeIdx === expected.tokenTypeIdx ||
      (expected.isParent &&
        !!(
          expected.MATCH_SET![token.tokenTypeIdx >> 5] &
          (1 << (token.tokenTypeIdx & 31))
        ))
    );
  }
  ```
- `augmentTokenTypes()` computes `MATCH_SET` (Uint32Array, one bit per possible
  tokenTypeIdx) and assigns `tokenTypeIdx` and `isParent`. No new properties
  are added — only sentinel values are overwritten. No hidden class transition.

**`IToken` — one shape for all position-tracking modes:**

```ts
// Single factory — positionTracking controls which fields get real values,
// not whether the fields exist
function createToken(...): IToken {
  return {
    image:                '',
    startOffset:          0,
    endOffset:            0,
    startLine:            0,
    endLine:              0,
    startColumn:          0,
    endColumn:            0,
    tokenTypeIdx:         0,
    tokenType:            tokType,
    payload:              undefined,
    isInsertedInRecovery: false,
  }
}
```

- `createOffsetOnlyToken`, `createStartOnlyToken`, `createFullToken` are
  replaced by a single factory. The position-tracking mode controls which
  fields are filled, not which fields exist.
- `isInsertedInRecovery` pre-declared as `false` — no longer added post-hoc
  during recovery. Recovery just sets it to `true`.
- `payload` pre-declared as `undefined` — no longer conditionally added.

**Lexer — fix `cloneEmptyGroups()` on every `tokenize()` call:**

- Pre-allocate a `resultGroups` structure in the Lexer instance at construction
  time with empty arrays for each group.
- On `reset()` between calls, truncate each array to length 0 instead of
  cloning the whole structure. Arrays retain their allocated capacity.

**`createTokenInstance` — direct call, not dynamically assigned property:**

- Currently `this.createTokenInstance` is a property assigned at lexer init
  pointing to one of the three factory variants. Call sites must go through a
  property lookup + indirect call — V8 cannot inline this reliably.
- With a single factory, replace with a direct call. The `if/else` for tracking
  mode happens inside the factory, which V8 can inline and optimize.

**Sentinel padding — replace push/pop loops with length assignment:**

`onBeforeParse` pads `tokVector` with `maxLookahead + 1` EOF sentinels using a
`.push()` loop, triggering array growth on every parse call. `onAfterParse`
removes them with a `.at(-1).pop()` loop (polyfill overhead). Replace both with
direct length manipulation:

```ts
// onBeforeParse
const sentinelCount = this.maxLookahead + 1;
this.tokVector.length = baseLength + sentinelCount; // no per-element cost
this.tokVector.fill(END_OF_FILE, baseLength);

// onAfterParse
this.tokVector.length -= sentinelCount; // single assignment
```

**Trivial lexer cleanup:**

`push_mode` (lexer_public.ts) assigns `currModePatternsLength` twice
consecutively — the second assignment is a dead write. Delete it.

#### Exit criteria

- All `TokenType` objects have identical shape regardless of `createToken()`
  config (verifiable via `%HaveSameMap` in V8 with `--allow-natives-syntax`).
- All `IToken` objects have identical shape regardless of lexer
  `positionTracking` mode.
- `categoryMatches` and `categoryMatchesMap` do not appear on any token type.
- `tokenMatcher()` produces identical results to the previous implementation
  for all token/category combinations (existing tests pass).
- `cloneEmptyGroups` is deleted; lexer uses reset-by-truncation.

---

### Stage 1 — Replace Error-based backtracking with SPEC_FAIL

**Goal:** Eliminate `Error.captureStackTrace` calls during speculative parsing,
and eliminate all heap allocation from the save/restore path.

#### What changes

- Add `const SPEC_FAIL = Object.freeze(Symbol('SPEC_FAIL'))` as the internal
  speculation sentinel.
- Add `IS_SPECULATING: boolean = false` to the parser state, mirroring the
  `RECORDING_PHASE` convention.
- In `consumeInternal()`: when `IS_SPECULATING === true` and the token does not
  match, throw `SPEC_FAIL` instead of `new MismatchedTokenException`.
- In `BACKTRACK()`: set `IS_SPECULATING = true` before the trial, restore it
  after, catch `SPEC_FAIL` as the failure signal.
- Replace all `isRecognitionException(e)` checks in catch blocks with
  `e === SPEC_FAIL` where appropriate.
- Remove `isBackTrackingStack: boolean[]` and `isBackTracking(): boolean`.
- `isBackTracking()` on the public API → returns `this.IS_SPECULATING` for
  backwards compat.

**Fix `saveRecogState()` — replace array cloning with integer snapshots:**

Currently `saveRecogState()` clones the errors array and slices the rule stack.
With SPEC_FAIL, speculative failures never produce real errors, so save state is
just three integers:

```ts
saveRecogState(): ParserSavepoint {
  return {
    pos:               this.currIdx,
    errorsLength:      this.errors.length,
    ruleStackDepth:    this.RULE_STACK_IDX,
  }
}

reloadRecogState(saved: ParserSavepoint): void {
  this.currIdx        = saved.pos
  this.errors.length  = saved.errorsLength       // truncate, no allocation
  this.RULE_STACK_IDX = saved.ruleStackDepth     // depth counter reset
}
```

No array copies, no slice. The savepoint object itself is three integers — V8
will often stack-allocate or scalar-replace this entirely in a hot loop.

**Fix `delete e.partialCstResult` in `recognizer_engine.ts`:**

`cstPostRule()` calls `delete e.partialCstResult` after consuming the partial
result from an in-flight exception. `delete` causes a hidden-class transition on
the exception object. Replace with assignment to `undefined`:

```ts
// Before:
delete e.partialCstResult;
// After:
e.partialCstResult = undefined;
```

Cold path, but eliminates the transition.

**Fix `findReSyncTokenType()` — O(n²) → O(n):**

Currently `flattenFollowSet()` builds a flat array of token types and
`findReSyncTokenType()` scans it with `.find()` per lookahead position —
O(follow set size) per token checked. Replace the array with a `Set`:

```ts
// flattenFollowSet returns Set<TokenType> instead of TokenType[]
const reSyncSet = this.flattenFollowSet(); // build once
while (true) {
  if (reSyncSet.has(nextToken.tokenType)) return nextToken.tokenType;
  nextToken = this.LA_FAST(k++);
}
```

Also switch the inner `LA(k)` call to `LA_FAST(k)` — the loop already guards
against going past EOF via the sentinel padding.

**Fix `flattenFollowSet()` — triple allocation → single pass:**

```ts
// Current: buildFullFollowKeyStack().map(...).flat() — three allocations
// Replacement: push directly into one Set
flattenFollowSet(): Set<TokenType> {
  const result = new Set<TokenType>()
  for (const key of this.buildFullFollowKeyStack()) {
    for (const tokType of this.getFollowSetFromFollowKey(key)) {
      result.add(tokType)
    }
  }
  return result
}
```

Note: `buildFullFollowKeyStack()` uses `shortRuleNameToFull` which is going
away in Stage 6. After Stage 6, `RULE_STACK` stores rule names directly,
eliminating the integer → string lookup and the follow key string concatenation
(`ruleName + idx + IN + inRule`) entirely.

#### Exit criteria

- All existing tests pass unchanged.
- `BACKTRACK()` returns `false` on mismatch without allocating an Error.
- A micro-benchmark of `BACKTRACK` on a failing rule shows zero `Error`
  objects created (verifiable via `--expose-gc` + `gc()` count).
- `saveRecogState()` does not call `.slice()` or create array copies.

---

### Stage 2 — Replace lookahead pre-computation with speculative OR()

**Goal:** Remove `Map.get()` + lookahead function call from every production.

#### What changes

- Rewrite `orInternal()` to iterate alternatives speculatively:
  - Save state (`pos`, `errors.length`, stack depth) — three integers.
  - Set `IS_SPECULATING = true`.
  - Call `alt.ALT()`.
  - On `SPEC_FAIL`: restore state, try next alternative.
  - On success: restore `IS_SPECULATING`, return result.
  - Last alternative: call without speculation (errors surface normally).
  - If `alt.GATE` is provided and passes: commit without speculation.
- Rewrite `manyInternal()`, `optionInternal()`, `atLeastOneInternal()`,
  `manySepInternal()`, `atLeastOneSepInternal()` to use the same
  try-speculatively / catch-SPEC_FAIL / break pattern.
- Delete `preComputeLookaheadFunctions()`.
- Delete `lookAheadFuncsCache` and all key-encoding utilities
  (`getKeyForAutomaticLookahead`, `BITS_FOR_METHOD_TYPE`,
  `BITS_FOR_OCCURRENCE_IDX`).
- `LLkLookaheadStrategy`: keep the class but make `buildLookaheadForAlternation`
  and `buildLookaheadForOptional` return no-op functions. Emit a deprecation
  warning if a custom `lookaheadStrategy` is passed in config.
- `maxLookahead` config option: keep accepted (no-op), emit deprecation warning.

#### Exit criteria

- All existing tests pass unchanged.
- Parser construction time drops measurably (no lookahead pre-computation).
- A grammar with 9-alternative `OR()` and the correct alternative last parses
  correctly.
- `lookAheadFuncsCache` does not exist on parser instances.

---

### Stage 3 — Remove numbered DSL variants as real implementations

**Goal:** Make `OR1`–`OR9` etc. true aliases with no extra overhead.

#### What changes

The numbered variants exist solely to provide unique `idx` values for
`getKeyForAutomaticLookahead`. With the cache gone, `idx` is meaningless.

- In `recognizer_api.ts`, replace all `OR1`–`OR9` implementations with:
  ```ts
  OR1 = this.OR;
  OR2 = this.OR;
  // ... etc
  ```
  Same for `CONSUME1`–`CONSUME9`, `SUBRULE1`–`SUBRULE9`, `MANY1`–`MANY9`,
  `OPTION1`–`OPTION9`, `AT_LEAST_ONE1`–`AT_LEAST_ONE9`,
  `MANY_SEP1`–`MANY_SEP9`, `AT_LEAST_ONE_SEP1`–`AT_LEAST_ONE_SEP9`.
- Remove the `idx` / `occurrence` parameter threading from internal methods
  (`orInternal`, `consumeInternal`, etc.) where it was only used for cache
  key computation.
- Keep `idx` in GAST node construction (needed for Stage 5 recording pass).

#### Exit criteria

- All existing tests pass unchanged.
- A grammar using `OR1`, `OR3`, `OR7` in the same rule produces correct output.
- The `idx` parameter still threads through to GAST recording (verified by
  Stage 5 tests).

---

### Stage 4 — Decouple CST building from the recording phase

**Goal:** `CstParser` works correctly without `performSelfAnalysis()` having
run, and CST construction minimises per-rule allocation.

#### What changes

**Runtime CST interception (replaces GAST-derived field names):**

- `CstParser` overrides `consumeInternal()`:
  ```ts
  const tok = super.consumeInternal(tokenType, opts);
  const key = opts?.LABEL ?? tokenType.name;
  (this._cstStack.at(-1).children[key] ??= []).push(tok);
  return tok;
  ```
- `CstParser` overrides `subruleInternal()`:
  ```ts
  const node = super.subruleInternal(rule, opts) as CstNode;
  const key = opts?.LABEL ?? rule.ruleName;
  (this._cstStack.at(-1).children[key] ??= []).push(node);
  return node;
  ```
- `RULE()` in `CstParser` wraps the implementation to push/pop `_cstStack`
  and call `_finalizeLocation(node)` on exit.
- `getBaseCstVisitorConstructor()` uses the rule registry built by `RULE()`
  (rule names only — no GAST needed).
- Delete the GAST-derived CST field-name pre-computation from `TreeBuilder`.

**Fix CstNode allocation — pre-declared fixed shape:**

`cstInvocationStateUpdate()` currently calls `Object.create(null)` for each
rule's children dict, which creates a new object every invocation. Replace with
a fixed-shape CstNode created via a factory that declares all fields upfront:

```ts
function createCstNode(name: string): CstNode {
  return {
    name,
    children: Object.create(null),
    recoveredNode: false,
    location: undefined, // filled in if location tracking enabled
  };
}
```

The `location` object is also pre-declared with a fixed shape:

```ts
function createCstLocation(): CstNodeLocation {
  return {
    startOffset: NaN,
    startLine: NaN,
    startColumn: NaN,
    endOffset: NaN,
    endLine: NaN,
    endColumn: NaN,
  };
}
```

This is allocated once per rule entry and overwritten — same number of objects
but fixed shape so all location objects share one hidden class.

**Fix `addTerminalToCst` single-element array creation:**

```ts
// Current — creates new single-element array on first occurrence:
node.children[key] = [token];

// Replacement — pre-allocate with capacity hint, or use ??= push pattern:
(node.children[key] ??= []).push(token);
```

The `??=` pattern is already inline-cache-friendly and avoids the hidden class
transition that `[token]` causes (empty array → 1-element array have different
internal representations in V8).

**Location tracking:**

`nodeLocationTracking: "none" | "onlyOffset" | "full"` handled by assigning
the appropriate update method at construction time — same strategy as existing
`TreeBuilder.initTreeBuilder()` but without GAST dependency.

#### Exit criteria

- `CstParser` produces identical CST output with and without
  `performSelfAnalysis()` having been called.
- All three `nodeLocationTracking` modes produce correct location info.
- `getBaseCstVisitorConstructor()` returns a valid base class with all rule
  names present.
- All `CstNodeLocation` objects share a single hidden class (verifiable via
  `%HaveSameMap`).
- Existing CST-based tests pass unchanged.

---

### Stage 5 — Make recording phase opt-in

**Goal:** `performSelfAnalysis()` is a no-op by default. GAST tooling works
when explicitly requested.

#### What changes

- `performSelfAnalysis()` default behaviour: register rule names, return
  immediately. No recording, no lookahead computation.
- Add config option `{ buildGast: true }` (or call `performSelfAnalysis()`
  with a flag) to trigger the full recording pass.
- The recording mechanism in `GastRecorder` (`enableRecording()`,
  `disableRecording()`, `topLevelRuleRecord()`, sentinel tokens) is preserved
  exactly — it just no longer runs unconditionally.
- `RECORDING_PHASE` is `false` by default; `true` only during an explicit
  recording pass.
- `serializeGrammar()`, `generateCstDts()`, `createSyntaxDiagramsCode()`,
  `getLookaheadPaths()`: throw a clear error if called without a prior GAST
  build, with a message pointing to the opt-in flag.
- Grammar validation (left-recursion detection, ambiguity warnings) moves
  inside the opt-in recording pass.

#### Exit criteria

- Parser construction with no `performSelfAnalysis()` call does not mutate
  instance methods (no hidden class transitions after construction).
- `performSelfAnalysis({ buildGast: true })` produces identical GAST output
  to the current mandatory recording pass.
- `serializeGrammar()` works after opt-in, throws with a clear message without.
- `generateCstDts()` and `createSyntaxDiagramsCode()` work after opt-in.
- All grammar validation tests pass when opt-in is used.

---

### Stage 6 — Flatten mixin architecture

**Goal:** Replace `applyMixins` composition with a direct class hierarchy.
Clean up the call graph for V8's inliner.

#### What changes

- Collapse the 9 traits into the three-class hierarchy:
  ```
  RecursiveDescentParser      ← absorbs: RecognizerEngine, RecognizerApi,
                                          LexerAdapter, ErrorHandler,
                                          LooksAhead (stub), Recoverable
  EmbeddedActionsParser       ← absorbs: PerformanceTracer, GastRecorder (opt-in)
  CstParser                   ← absorbs: TreeBuilder (runtime version from Stage 4)
  ```
- Delete `applyMixins` and `parser_traits.ts` `MixedInParser` type.
- The `Parser` base class (currently just a deprecation shim) points to
  `EmbeddedActionsParser` and emits a console warning.
- All trait files (`recognizer_engine.ts`, `recognizer_api.ts`, etc.) are
  deleted or folded in. File structure becomes:
  ```
  src/parse/parser/
    recursive_descent_parser.ts
    embedded_actions_parser.ts
    cst_parser.ts
    gast_recorder.ts          ← unchanged, now only called opt-in
    recoverable.ts            ← unchanged
    perf_tracer.ts            ← unchanged
  ```

#### Exit criteria

- No `applyMixins` calls remain.
- `instanceof CstParser` and `instanceof EmbeddedActionsParser` work correctly.
- The `Parser` deprecated shim emits a warning and delegates correctly.
- All existing tests pass unchanged.
- Bundle size is measurably smaller (dead trait infrastructure removed).

---

### Stage 7 — Benchmarks

**Goal:** Quantify all gains with the existing benchmark infrastructure.

#### What changes

- Run the three existing `benchmark_web` grammars (JSON, CSS, ECMA5) unchanged
  against both the old engine (pinned at `v12.0.0`) and the new engine.
  No grammar changes should be required — identical source code is the
  backwards-compatibility proof.
- Extend `bench_logic.js` to show three columns: `latest` (v12), `next` (this
  branch), `delta`.
- Add two separate benchmark modes:
  - **Init time**: parser construction only, no input parsed. Isolates recording
    phase + lookahead precomputation cost.
  - **Parse time**: construction amortized, measure repeated parse calls.
    Isolates per-parse engine cost.
- Document results in `benchmark_web/README.md` with the V8 cost explanations
  from this plan.

#### Exit criteria

- Init time is measurably lower for all three grammars with the new engine.
- Parse time is equal or better for all three grammars with the new engine.
- No correctness regressions: benchmark parsers produce identical output on
  the same input against both engines.
- Results are reproducible across three consecutive benchmark runs (Benchmark.js
  `minSamples: 25` default).

## Development Process

### Running tests

Each stage ends with a green test suite. The standard commands are:

```bash
# From the repo root — compile + bundle + test the chevrotain package
cd packages/chevrotain && bun run ci

# Quick iteration during development (compile + mocha, no bundle step)
cd packages/chevrotain && bun run build && bun run unit-tests

# Full repo CI (format check + all subpackages)
bun run ci
```

`bun run ci` in the `packages/chevrotain` directory expands to
`bun run build test`, i.e. `clean → compile → bundle → coverage`.

### Commit format

This repo uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
The commit-msg hook enforces it via `commitlint`. Use one of:

```
feat: <summary>          ← new capability visible to users
fix: <summary>           ← bug fix
perf: <summary>          ← performance improvement with no API change
refactor: <summary>      ← internal restructuring, no behaviour change
test: <summary>          ← test-only change
chore: <summary>         ← build / tooling / meta change
```

Each stage lands as one commit (or a small series of `refactor:`/`perf:`
commits if the diff is large). The commit message body should reference the
relevant stage from this plan and state what exit criteria it satisfies.

Example commit for Stage 0:

```
perf: settle TokenType and IToken hidden-class shapes (stage 0)

- createToken() pre-declares all fields with sentinel values so every
  TokenType object shares a single V8 hidden class from birth.
- Three IToken factory variants unified: all produce the same property
  set; positionTracking mode controls values, not shape.
- MATCH_SET (Uint32Array bitset) replaces categoryMatchesMap for O(1)
  category membership checks in tokenStructuredMatcher.
- Lexer group-key caching replaces Object.keys() call per tokenize().
- Dead write in push_mode removed.

Exits: Stage 0 exit criteria — all existing tests pass.
```

## Stage Dependencies

```
Stage 0 (token/IToken shapes)  ← prerequisite for everything
  └─ Stage 1 (SPEC_FAIL + saveRecogState)
       └─ Stage 2 (speculative OR)
            └─ Stage 3 (numbered variant aliases)
                 ├─ Stage 4 (runtime CST + CST allocation fixes)
                 │    └─ Stage 5 (opt-in recording)
                 │         └─ Stage 6 (flatten mixins)
                 └─ Stage 7 (benchmarks)  ← can start after Stage 2
```

Stages 4 and 5 can be developed in parallel once Stage 3 is done.
Stage 7 can begin as soon as Stage 2 is complete — early benchmark data is
useful for motivating Stages 4–6.
